# chatbot
A messenger chatbot to send (born on this day) messages to subscribed users based on topics currently supports arabic language but you can change
messages easily and expected responses to support any language.

The project uses Flask framework for handling requests, SQL database to store user preferences and APscheduler to schedule both daily database check
and sending the messages to the subscribed users.


# TODO
* A default homepage for the chatbot
* A dashboard to make it easy to add and update the data stored in the DB




_P.S: This project made by a complete newbie and was intended as a training project so the code quality is not perfect (both styling and codeflow itself)_
